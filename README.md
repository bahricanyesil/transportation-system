Transportation System Project - Object Oriented Programming

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

In  this  project,  you  are  required  to  implement  a  simulation  of  a  transportation  system. The main objective is to analyze the incoming requests provided as a list of input, and carrying out the necessary actions. 
There are two types of passengers, discounted and standard, which are able to ride the bus or the train, or drive their own cars to travel. The passengers can refill their travel cards, purchase a car and refuel their cars. Each public transport vehicle has an  operating  range  in  the  shape  of  a  rectangle.  While  the  bus  fare  is  fixed,  the  trains charge per stop.
